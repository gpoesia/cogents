CS236 project

TODO:

- [ ] Basic pipeline:
  - [ ] Load & tokenize dataset
  - [ ] Train a simple Transformer language model
  - [ ] Evaluate perplexity on test data
- [ ] Baselines:
  - [ ] Language model with Text-to-Text objective (see T5)
  - [ ] Fill-in-the-blanks paper
- [ ] Model:
  - [ ] LM with signal embedding (the "slices") + variational global embedding
  - [ ] Model with richer prior (can try GMM like in hw2)
